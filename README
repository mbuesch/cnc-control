--- Integrating CNC-Control into EMC2 ---

EMC 2.5.0(-pre) or later is required.

Integration into EMC2 is easy, because the CNC-Control HAL file is pretty
much selfcontained. Just copy the driver/cnccontrol.hal file to your EMC2
configuration directory. Then modify your .ini file to load the new .hal file.
EMC2 can load multiple HAL files. So all that is needed usually is to add
a line like this
HALFILE = cnccontrol.hal
to the end of the [HAL] section of your .ini file. Add the new HALFILE line
below any exitsing HALFILE line.

To install the HAL driver, just copy it somewhere you can execute files from.
We suggest to just copy the driver to the EMC2 configuration directory as well:
cp -a driver/{cnccontrol_driver.py,emc2hal_cnccontrol} /MY/EMC2/CONFIG/DIRECTORY/
After that you need to adjust your PATH environment variable to include
the EMC2 config directory (or the directory where you put the files).

As the CNC-Control HAL driver has to access the CNC-Control USB device, either
startup EMC as root, or configure your USB device permissions (udev) to allow
binding the userspace USB driver as restricted user to the device.

All configuration of the CNC-Control device can be done through the
cnccontrol.hal file. Just look into the file and read the comments.
